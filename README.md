# AWS-v0.1
## AWS or Automated Weather Station is an ESP32 based weather monitoring module 
Many weather forecast websites allow users to view forecasts up to five years in advance, but the exact conditions for a specific location may not be quite accurate. Most of the readings from the station are accurate within a radius of 1-5km. Readings at locations beyond that radius are generally of average to low accuracy. Using a low-cost AWS cluster, the data provided would be much more location-specific and accurate, leading to better weather forecasts.
 **Zambretti equation** is used to forecast the weather for this project. A forecast index is calculated based on the pressure trend calculated from the on-read pressure value. Every 10 minutes the device gather environmental data. The pressure for each reading is stored in an array. The array is divided after 3 hours into a previous pressure reading and a subsequent pressure reading. The trend of dropping, stable, or rising is calculated on the basis of the difference between the two. 
 In V.01, the forecast index used here does not take into account the season and the wind direction, which will be updated in the future.
 The project supports for both **ESP32** and **ESP8266** board. All the sensors expect the UV and Raindrop are I2C based.
 Choosing the right sensors for this project is important. Though there are many environmental-based sensors in the market with a variety of price points, sometimes choosing the right one is difficult. An Arduino forum just solved the issue. Based on the work by **lilitu** on comparison of temperature and humidity testing via i2c, broad results were obtained and from the data, the best sensor could be selected.

 Even though DHT22 is used most commonly for temperature and humidity, they have a short life compared to others. The hysteresis of the sensor is also another factor. Some sensors give a fluctuating reading at a particular point that requires time to get back to a normal state. 

 The library attached here could help in case of error. The most common erroe that might happen is the anologRead which was a big issue  in ESP32

 The data obtained by the sensors are updated to the SQL database. The tutorial would be linked down below:

 The PHP scripts were edited to suit this project which would be in the docs section of the repo. Place them into the public_html of the file manager from ur respective hosting service
 **Donâ€™t forget the change the apiKey and database credentials.**
